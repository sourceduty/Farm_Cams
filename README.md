This project presents a rugged, compact surveillance and data acquisition unit, tailored for deployment in remote or outdoor environments. At the heart of the system is a Raspberry Pi single-board computer housed within a weatherproof white plastic junction box. Mounted securely to a wooden utility pole, the enclosure is designed to protect sensitive electronics from the elements while providing easy access through its hinged front door. Inside, the Raspberry Pi is connected to several wires, indicating multiple sensors or communication interfaces. This setup is ideal for applications ranging from environmental monitoring to wildlife observation, where resilience and ease of maintenance are crucial.

Below the junction box, a transparent cylindrical tube made of clear plastic houses a compact surveillance camera. This design allows for unobstructed visual monitoring while shielding the camera from rain, dust, or debris. The cylindrical form not only enhances protection but also reduces glare and reflections that can interfere with image quality. A data or power cable runs from the tube back into the junction box, ensuring that the camera is seamlessly integrated into the main processing system. The positioning of the camera under the electronics enclosure provides a stable vantage point while minimizing its visual impact, making the system both efficient and discreet.

With the sky as a backdrop and natural wooden mounting, the installation merges technology with the landscape in a visually pleasing way, suggesting practical use in eco-conscious or minimally invasive applications. The integration of consumer-grade computing hardware like the Raspberry Pi with robust, weather-resistant design highlights the growing trend of DIY and open-source technologies meeting professional-grade requirements. Whether used for field research, rural security, or smart agriculture, this project exemplifies how off-the-shelf components can be intelligently repurposed into dependable, cost-effective infrastructure. It opens possibilities for scaling similar installations across multiple sites without significant overhead.

Building this surveillance and monitoring system using two camera units and one central node involves both hardware acquisition and installation time. Each camera unit includes a Raspberry Pi (approximately 60 CAD), a waterproof junction box (about 25 CAD), wiring and connectors (around 15 CAD), and a clear plastic camera housing (estimated at 30 CAD). The camera module itself, suitable for a Raspberry Pi such as the Camera Module 3, costs roughly 45 CAD. This brings the cost per camera unit to around 175 CAD. The central node, which might use a higher-spec Raspberry Pi or similar single-board computer, would require additional components like power management hardware (such as a UPS battery module or solar controller) and communication modules such as Wi-Fi or LoRa (about 50 CAD). Factoring in these parts, the node would cost approximately 250 CAD. Including tools, mounting brackets, and incidental materials (about 50 CAD), the total hardware cost for the entire system would be between 650 and 700 CAD.

Installation time also needs to be considered. Each unit is expected to take roughly three to four hours to assemble, test, and mount. This includes tasks such as installing the operating system, configuring the software, wiring and securing the hardware, sealing the enclosures, and mounting the system on poles. With three units in total, the full installation would take about 10 to 12 hours. Assuming a technicianâ€™s rate of 60 CAD per hour, the total labor cost would range from 600 to 720 CAD. Combined with hardware, the full project is estimated to cost between 1,250 and 1,400 CAD. This estimate could increase if additional components such as trenching for power lines, solar panels, or wireless data subscriptions are necessary, especially for installations in more remote areas.
